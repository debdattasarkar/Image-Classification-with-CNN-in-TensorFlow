# Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow: Fashion Item Classifier

 <a href="https://www.udemy.com/labs/image-classification-with-convolutional-neural-networks-in-tensorflow-fashion-item-classifier/overview/"> ![Udemy](https://img.shields.io/badge/Udemy-EC5252?style=for-the-badge&logo=Udemy&logoColor=white) </a>

At TrendSetter, our ambition is to consistently remain at the forefront of the fashion e-commerce industry. As the market grows more competitive, our platform has been receiving an exponentially larger influx of fashion items daily. This increase has created a challenge in terms of efficiently categorizing and presenting these items to our users in a way that aligns with their preferences and needs. The current manual classification methods and rudimentary algorithms in place have become less effective, leading to suboptimal user experience and potential decreases in sales conversions.

Your objective is clear: Utilize the Fashion MNIST dataset to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that can efficiently classify images into their respective fashion categories. It's vital that this model is resilient to various image conditions; thus, implementing data augmentation techniques will be crucial. Furthermore, for transparency and interpretability in our model's decisions, I would like you to integrate advanced visualization techniques, such as Grad-CAM. By the culmination of this project, the expectation is to have a deployable CNN model that's capable of accurately identifying and categorizing fashion items. The datasets and necessary resources have been provisioned for you. Your expertise in this will set the groundwork for our platform's next phase of evolution. Let's set the benchmark in intelligent fashion e-commerce.

## Lab scenario
You are a machine learning engineer at TrendSetter, a pioneering fashion e-commerce firm. The company aims to enhance its users' shopping experience and has tasked you with creating a solution. Using the Fashion MNIST dataset, you decide to construct a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that can swiftly and accurately classify images into one of ten fashion categories. To enhance your model's resilience and adaptability, you'll implement data augmentation and delve into advanced visualization techniques like Grad-CAM for interpretability. By the end of this lab, you'll have a deployable model that can identify and categorize fashion items from simple images, paving the way for a smarter shopping platform.

## Objectives
- Visualize individual images from the dataset, allowing for a better understanding of the image content and its associated class.
- Implement data normalization techniques to prepare images for input into a convolutional neural network (CNN).
- Apply data augmentation strategies to artificially enhance the dataset and improve model generalization.
- Construct a convolutional neural network using TensorFlow/Keras and understand each layer's role.
- Optimize the model training process using callbacks such as early stopping and learning rate scheduling.
- Evaluate the CNN's performance by visualizing its accuracy and loss over epochs and interpreting its confusion matrix.
- Utilize Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to interpret and understand the model's decision-making process on specific images.
- Deploy a trained model by saving and loading it, then using it for making predictions on new data.
